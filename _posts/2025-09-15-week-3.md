title: Week 3 - Defensive Coverage & Exit Strategies
categories:
  - practice
---

After a solid tiering weekend and a couple good exhibition games, we now work towards the start of the league season this weekend. This past weekend, we definitely figured out how to score goals with a very nice 13 goal effort in 2 games including a lot of "team" goals rather than solo efforts. The struggle for the weekend was defensive zone exits.

The focus this week is on cleaning up our own end of the ice and working on more consistent breakouts. If we can lockdown our own zone and prevent getting trapped, we will have a lot more early season success leading into our first tournament.
