title: Week 4 - Problem Solving w/ Triangles & Passing
categories:

While it would have been nice to have a pair of wins this weekend, splitting the series 1-1 against a tough AAA team was not a poor performance. The second game, I felt like we lacked some compete relative to the first game. We weren't doing a good job as a team to create opportunities for each other.

This week, the focus shifts to 'Problem Solving'. We talked a lot on Sunday about hockey being a game of problem solving. When a particular tactic is not working after a few tries, we need to find another approach. In this case, skating into and / or trying to go around multiple opponents was causing us a lot of problems. Finding solutions to work ourselves around those players is the goal.

Come ready to compete and use our hockey IQ to prepare for Spokane this coming weekend.
