The past weekend games had some ups and downs. The first game, we held our own for parts of that game but were ultimately beat by lost focus. Small mistakes added up to a quick few goals that put the game out of our reach. Last Thursday classroom was a conversation about mental fortitude and what it takes to stay engaged and compete for a full game.

The team rebounded with a strong game on Sunday. Loss of focus late in the 3rd period combined with a hard push by the other team almost cost us the game. Ultimately, the team held together, tried to use the mental reset word, and came out with a much needed win. That was a great way to end the weekend and move into the tournament next weekend.

This week's practices, we will continue to work on physicality and compete. However, the focus in drills are 2 big things. First, working on good defensive structure and skating routes to prevent the drive-by misses that happened throughout our early season games. Second, we will be working on figuring out the triangles to see if we can create more sustained offensive pressure and generate more scoring chances.

Tournaments are hard. Especially at the level we hope to compete at, they take resilience and mental fortitude over several games in the span of a couple days. Keep working on building your mental strength, come to practice to compete and win. Then, bring your best level of compete this weekend.
