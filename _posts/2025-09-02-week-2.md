title: Week 2 - Angling & Triangles
categories:
  - practice
---

Tiering was fun! Some close games, and a lot of things to work on. This week's practices will put an emphasis on using good angling to direct opponents to areas we dictate. We will also be working on 'triangles'. How do we go about setting up triangles and 2v1 scenarios all around the ice. This includes defending against those same techniques we use to generate offense.
